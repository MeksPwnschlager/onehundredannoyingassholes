depending on what deals you get on the components.

## Making your own


### 1. Search for and buy the needed components at the electronics merchant of your choice.

For big orders `aliexpress.com` might be one of the cheaper options

### 2. Order the PCBs

We used `seeedstudio.com`, but `dirtypcbs.com` is also a cheap alternative. Maybe even buy a solder stencil to make your life easier!

### 3. Flash the chips

Use the included arduino code to flash the ATTiny25 using a POMONA Clip or other means of electrical contact and an AVR programmer.

### 4. Solder, Solder, Solder

Solder the SMD and normal compontents onto the board.

### 5. Annoy

Place the battery in the battery holder (duh) and listen to them beep!
